# ContractConfigurator-GroundStations

## Synopsis

While Kerbin is repleate with ground stations to relay data back to the KSC, the rest of the Kerbal Universe is ground station poor. With this contract pack the Player will be asked to provide additional ground stations to help Kerbals phone home.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the GitHub respository. Expand the ZIP file and place the contents in your _GameData_ folder.

## Requirements

To use a custom contract pack you will need [ContractConfigurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-130-contract-configurator-v1232-2017-08-03/) by nightingale.

Right off the bat the Player will be asked to add ground stations to Kerbin. You will need to have unlocked a relay antenna first (this is currently not enforced as a REQUIREMENT but is as a PARAMETER). After that, new contracts will appear for every orbited body.

Initial contract offers have a short lifecycle, so be sure to pick them up promptly. You should have plenty of time to complete the contract once accepted.

## Points of Interest

It is assumed the Player will disable ground stations on Kerbin from the _Advanced_ options of their game, but this is not required.

There is currently no easy way to determine if a given ground station has a route back to the KSC. Any antenna will do, provided it has _relay_ capability. This includes antenna from mods.

## Future Plans

- Set a suitable REQUIREMENT before contracts start being offered on Kerbin and elsewhere
- Compute the antenna strength required for a given contract to be offered and display that to the Player on the contract
- More tightly integrate with other mods such as [RemoteTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139167-13-remotetech-v188-2017-09-03/)
